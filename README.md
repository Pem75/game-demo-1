## Project description

* We plan to use Unreal Engine 4 to create a simple demo of a souls-like action game in this project.    <br>
* We are inspried by "Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice." <br>
*  Our goal is to achieve a realistic and intensive battle between the player and AI enemies.<br> 
*  Most animations and sound effects are not made by us. However, we bought them on Epic market, which allows us to use them(even commercially).<br>
*  Please use the link to download the game. We are not allowed to upload it to Gighub since it is too big.
