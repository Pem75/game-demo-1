## Project description
------
* We plan to use unreal engine 4 to create a simple demo of a souls-like action game in this project. This idea is from "Sekiro: Shadow Die Twice." Our goal is to achieve a realistic and intensive battle between the player and AI enemy. Therefore, we need to solve issues such as striking feeling and motion consistency. To make this demo more enjoyable and souls-like, design of Ai would be of great importance. Consedering we are rookies and to reduce complicated work, we would use free models from the Internet and pruchased models.
