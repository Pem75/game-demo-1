## Project description
------
* We plan to use unreal engine 4 to create a simple demo of a souls-like action game in this project.    <br>   * We are inspried by "Sekiro: Shadow Die Twice." <br> * Our goal is to achieve a realistic and intensive battle between the player and AI enemies. Therefore, we need to solve issues such as <br> *    striking feeling <br> *   motion consistency. <br> *  To make this demo more enjoyable and souls-like, design of Ai would be of great importance. Consedering we are rookies and to reduce complicated work, we would use free models from the Internet and pruchased models.
