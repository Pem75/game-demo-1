## Project description

* We plan to use Unreal Engine 4 to create a simple demo of a souls-like action game in this project.    <br>
* We are inspried by "Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice." <br>
*  Our goal is to achieve a realistic and intensive battle between the player and AI enemies.<br>
*  We attempt to solve issues such as striking feeling, designing Ai and motion consistency.<br>   
*  Consedering we are rookies and to reduce work amount, we would use free models from the Internet and purchased models.
*  Please use the link to download the game. We are not allowed to upload it to Gighub since it is too big.
